We first develop a real-time detection approach that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to detect flow-level packet-manipulation traces and an algorithm for IP-level detection based on Threshold Random Walk (TRW). We take the first steps toward detection-resilient censorship evasion by presenting DeResistor, a system that facilitates detection-resilient probing for packet-manipulation-based censorship evasion. DeResistor aims to defuse detection logic employed by censors by performing detection-guided pausing of censorship evasion attempts and interleaving them with normal user-driven network activity. We evaluate our techniques by leveraging Geneva, a state-of-the-art evasion strategy generator, and validate them against 11 simulated censors supplied by Geneva, while also testing them against real-world censors (i.e., Chinaâ€™s Great Firewall (GFW) and India). From an adversarial perspective, our proposed real-time detection method can quickly detect clients that attempt to probe censorship middleboxes with manipulated packets after inspecting only two probing flows. From a defense perspective, DeResistor is effective at shielding Geneva training from detection while enabling it to narrow the search space to produce less detectable traffic. Importantly, censorship evasion strategies generated using DeResistor can attain a high success rate from different vantage points against the GFW (up to 98% ) and 100% in India. Finally, we discuss detection countermeasures and extensibility of our approach to other censor-probing-based tools.","tags":null,"title":"DeResistor: Toward Detection-Resistant Probing for Evasion of Internet Censorship","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Probir Roy","Birhanu Eshete","Pengfei Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677910650,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677910650,"objectID":"4407174cdf608cfbd81bad47f1d947ac","permalink":"/publication/cerberus-2023.html","publishdate":"2023-03-04T01:17:30-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cerberus-2023.html","section":"publication","summary":"In modern CPU architectures, last-level caches (LLCs) are typically shared among multiple CPU cores. LLCs enable data sharing across application threads and promote data reusability. However, due to limited resources, an efficient utilization of LLCs is vital for application performance. One effective way to understand the LLC usage is using hardware performance counters to measure the LLC performance metrics such as hit and miss ratios. Given the benefits of hardware counter based performance metrics, enabling these metrics in a multi-tenant environment is challenging due to security implications. An adversary can exploit these metrics for various side-channel attacks. Current mitigation policies simply restrict the access of performance metrics which limits the legitimate use of these metrics for performance monitoring and optimization. This paper addresses the vulnerability of LLC metrics as an accessory to side-channel attacks. This paper proposes novel secure performance metrics, CERBERUS, aimed at limiting LLC performance counter-based side-channel vulnerability while providing usable performance insights. The key insight in CERBERUS is that it leverages a differentially private mechanism to make the side-channels undetectable to adversaries. Through a systematic evaluation of benchmark performance monitoring scenarios, we show that CERBERUS's performance metrics are usable for LLC-aware profile-guided compiler optimization.","tags":null,"title":"Designing Secure Performance Metrics for Last-Level Cache","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ismat Jarin","Birhanu Eshete"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672813050,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672813050,"objectID":"92bc3cb007ab86c7c8d0ef66f300457b","permalink":"/publication/miashield.html","publishdate":"2023-01-04T01:17:30-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/miashield.html","section":"publication","summary":"In membership inference attacks (MIAs), an adversary observes the predictions of a model to determine whether a sample is part of the model's training data. Existing MIA defenses conceal the presence of a target sample through strong regularization, knowledge distillation, confidence masking, or differential privacy. We propose MIAShield, a new MIA defense based on preemptive exclusion of member samples instead of masking the presence of a member. MIAShield departs from prior defenses in that it weakens the strong membership signal that stems from the presence of a target sample by preemptively excluding it at prediction time without compromising model utility. To that end, we design and evaluate a suite of preemptive exclusion oracles leveraging model confidence, exact/approximate sample signature, and learning-based exclusion of member data points. To be practical, MIAShield splits a training data into disjoint subsets and trains each subset to build an ensemble of models. The disjointedness of subsets ensures that a target sample belongs to only one subset, which isolates the sample to facilitate the preemptive exclusion goal. We evaluate MIAShield on three benchmark image classification datasets. We show that MIAShield effectively mitigates membership inference (near random guess) for a wide range of MIAs; achieves far better privacy-utility trade-off compared with state-of-the-art defenses; and remains resilient in the face of adaptive attacks.","tags":null,"title":"MIAShield: Defending Membership Inference Attacks via Preemptive Exclusion of Members","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We study robustness (to training data poisoning, model evasion, model stealing), privacy (against training example membership inference), and the interaction among robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness properties in machine learning.\n","date":1665705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665705600,"objectID":"fdf1171303ca344063ccbf69375b20af","permalink":"/project/aml.html","publishdate":"2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/aml.html","section":"project","summary":"We study robustness (to training data poisoning, model evasion, model stealing), privacy (against training example membership inference), and the interaction among robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness properties in machine learning.","tags":["Trustworthy Machine Learning"],"title":"Trustworthy Machine Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":["Abderrahmen Amich","Birhanu Eshete","Vinod Yegneswaran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664518650,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664518650,"objectID":"a9f4e6b4c283211a514d75576d77a543","permalink":"/publication/wpes22.html","publishdate":"2022-09-30T01:17:30-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wpes22.html","section":"publication","summary":"The arms race between Internet freedom technologists and censoring regimes has catalyzed the deployment of more sophisticated censoring techniques and directed significant research emphasis toward the development of automated tools for censorship measurement and evasion.

In machine learning (ML), DP has been employed to limit inference/disclosure of training examples. Prior work leveraged DP across the ML pipeline, albeit in isolation, often focusing on mechanisms such as gradient perturbation. In this paper, we present, DP-UTIL, a holistic utility analysis framework of DP across the ML pipeline with focus on input perturbation, objective perturbation, gradient perturbation, output perturbation, and prediction perturbation. Given an ML task on  privacy-sensitive data, DP-UTIL enables a ML privacy practitioner perform holistic comparative analysis on the impact of DP in these five perturbation spots, measured in terms of model utility loss, privacy leakage, and the number of truly revealed training samples. We evaluate DP-UTIL over classification tasks on vision, medical, and financial datasets, using two representative learning algorithms (logistic regression and deep neural network) against membership inference attack as a case study attack. One of the highlights of our results is that prediction perturbation consistently achieves the lowest utility loss on all models across all datasets. In logistic regression models, objective  perturbation results in lowest privacy  leakage  compared  to  other perturbation techniques. For deep neural networks, gradient perturbation results in lowest privacy leakage. Moreover, our results on true revealed records suggest that as privacy leakage increases a differentially private model reveals more number of member samples. Overall, our findings suggest that to make informed decisions as to which perturbation mechanism to use, a ML privacy practitioner needs to examine the dynamics between optimization techniques (convex vs. non-convex), perturbation mechanisms, number of classes, and privacy budget.","tags":null,"title":"DP-UTIL: Comprehensive Utility Analysis of Differential Privacy in Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abderrahmen Amich","Birhanu Eshete"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1641017850,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641017850,"objectID":"69a6dab587a93d6a7b94022802609db0","permalink":"/publication/eg-booster.html","publishdate":"2022-01-01T01:17:30-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eg-booster.html","section":"publication","summary":"The widespread usage of machine learning (ML) in a myriad of domains has raised questions about its trustworthiness in securitycritical environments. Part of the quest for trustworthy ML is robustness evaluation of ML models to test-time adversarial examples. Inline with the trustworthy ML goal, a useful input to potentially aid robustness evaluation is feature-based explanations of model predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach called EG-Booster that leverages techniques from explainable ML to guide adversarial example crafting for improved robustness evaluation of ML models before deploying them in security-critical settings. The key insight in EG-Booster is the use of feature-based explanations of model predictions to guide adversarial example crafting by adding consequential perturbations likely to result in model evasion and avoiding non-consequential ones unlikely to contribute to evasion. EG-Booster is agnostic to model architecture, threat model, and supports diverse distance metrics used previously in the literature. We evaluate EG-Booster using image classification benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR10. Our findings suggest that EG-Booster significantly improves evasion rate of state-of-the-art attacks while performing less number of perturbations. Through extensive experiments that covers four white-box and three black-box attacks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EG-Booster against two undefended neural networks trained on MNIST and CIFAR10, and another adversarially-trained ResNet model trained on CIFAR10. Furthermore, we introduce a stability assessment metric and evaluate the reliability of our explanation-based approach by observing the similarity between the modelâ€™s classification outputs across multiple runs of EG-Booster. Our results across 10 different runs suggest that EG-Boosterâ€™s output is stable across distinct runs. Combined with state-of-the-art attacks, we hope EG-Booster will be used as a benchmark in future work that evaluate robustness of ML models to evasion attacks.","tags":null,"title":"EG-Booster: Explanation-Guided Booster of ML Evasion Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abderrahmen Amich","Birhanu Eshete"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630131450,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630131450,"objectID":"85a01e96bb1faf734aeadc1aa5e4c00c","permalink":"/publication/acsac21.html","publishdate":"2021-08-28T01:17:30-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acsac21.html","section":"publication","summary":"Robustness to adversarial examples of machine learning models remains an open topic of research. Attacks often succeed by repeatedly probing a fixed target model with adversarial examples purposely crafted to fool it.

By regularly moving the decision function of a model, Morphence makes it significantly challenging for repeated or correlated attacks to succeed. Morphence deploys a pool of models generated from a base model in a manner that introduces sufficient randomness when it responds to prediction queries. To ensure repeated or correlated attacks fail, the deployed pool of models automatically expires after a query budget is reached and the model pool is seamlessly replaced by a new model pool generated in advance. We evaluate Morphence on two benchmark image classification datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10) against five reference attacks (2 white-box and 3 black-box). In all cases, Morphence consistently outperforms the thus-far effective defense, adversarial training, even in the face of strong white-box attacks, while preserving accuracy on clean data.","tags":null,"title":"Morphence: Moving Target Defense Against Adversarial Examples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Birhanu Eshete"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628749050,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628749050,"objectID":"cbe2158fa655240b56ae6b495533c333","permalink":"/publication/science2021.html","publishdate":"2021-08-12T01:17:30-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/science2021.html","section":"publication","summary":"Machine learning (ML) has advanced dramatically during the past decade and continues to achieve impressive human-level performance on nontrivial tasks in image, speech, and text recognition.

SMPC enables secret-sharing of private models and client inputs with non-colluding secure servers to compute predictions without leaking model parameters and inputs. DP masks true prediction results via noisy aggregation so as to deter a semi-honest client who may mount membership inference attacks. We evaluate PRICURE on neural networks across four datasets including benchmark medical image classification datasets. Our results suggest PRICURE guarantees privacy for tens of model owners and clients with acceptable accuracy loss. We also show that DP reduces membership inference attack exposure without hurting accuracy.","tags":null,"title":"PRICURE: Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Inference in a Multi-Party Setting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdullah Ali","**Birhanu Eshete**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593357450,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593357450,"objectID":"4d003612fa4573e3496083b71c147ff7","permalink":"/publication/securecomm20.html","publishdate":"2020-06-28T10:17:30-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/securecomm20.html","section":"publication","summary":"An adversary who aims to steal a black-box model repeatedly queries the model via a prediction API to learn a function that approximates its decision boundary. Adversarial approximation is non-trivial because of the enormous combinations of model architectures, parameters, and features to explore. In this context, the adversary resorts to a best-effort strategy that yields the closest approximation. This paper explores best-effort adversarial approximation of a black-box malware classifier in the most challenging setting, where the adversary's knowledge is limited to a prediction label for a given input. Beginning with a limited input set for the black-box classifier, we leverage feature representation mapping and cross-domain transferability to approximate a black-box malware classifier by locally training a substitute. Our approach approximates the target model with different feature types for the target and the substitute model while also using non-overlapping data for training the target, training the substitute, and the comparison of the two. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against two black-box classifiers trained on Windows Portable Executables (PEs). Against a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on raw byte sequences of PEs, our approach achieves a 92% accurate substitute (trained on pixel representations of PEs), and nearly 90% prediction agreement between the target and the substitute model. Against a 97.8% accurate gradient boosted decision tree trained on static PE features, our 91% accurate substitute agrees with the black-box on 90% of predictions, suggesting the strength of our purely black-box approximation.","tags":null,"title":"Best-Effort Adversarial Approximation of Black-Box Malware Classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our focus is on systematic curation, characterization, measurement, and forensics of cyber threat intelligence (e.g., malware samples, infection traces, natural language threat descriptions).\n","date":1571011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571011200,"objectID":"f0f4bb57fa119718f8c763936a92b234","permalink":"/project/cti.html","publishdate":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cti.html","section":"project","summary":"Our focus is on systematic curation, characterization, measurement, and forensics of cyber threat intelligence (e.g., malware samples, infection traces, natural language threat descriptions).","tags":["CTI"],"title":"Cyber Threat Intelligence","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sadegh M.

In this paper, we propose a system, called Poirot, which uses these correlations to uncover the steps of a successful attack campaign. We use kernel audits as a reliable source that covers all causal relations and information flows among system entities and model threat hunting as an inexact graph pattern matching problem. Our technical approach is based on a novel similarity metric which assesses an alignment between a query graph constructed out of CTI correlations and a provenance graph constructed out of kernel audit log records. We evaluate Poirot on publicly released real-world incident reports as well as reports of an adversarial engagement designed by DARPA, including ten distinct attack campaigns against different OS platforms such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Our evaluation results show that Poirot is capable of searching inside graphs containing millions of nodes and pinpoint the attacks in a few minutes, and the results serve to illustrate that CTI correlations could be used as robust and reliable artifacts for threat hunting","tags":[],"title":"Poirot: Aligning Attack Behavior with Kernel Audit Records for Cyber Threat Hunting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sadegh M.

One of the main challenges addressed by our approach involves developing a suite of techniques that make the detection signal robust and reliable. At a high-level, the techniques we develop effectively leverage the correlation between suspicious information flows that arise during an attacker campaign. In addition to its detection capability, our system (called HOLMES) is also able to generate a high-level graph that summarizes the attackerâ€™s actions in real-time. This graph can be used by an analyst for an effective cyber response. In addition to operating as a detection system by itself, the system can be co-deployed with other IDS systems to improve cyber detection and response within the enterprise. An evaluation of our approach against some real-world APTs indicates that our system can detect APT campaigns with high precision and low false alarm rate, and the compact high-level graphs produced by our system is an effective summary of an attack campaign that is useful for planning real-time cyber-response operations.","tags":[],"title":"HOLMES: Real-time APT Detection through Correlation of Suspicious Information Flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sadegh M.

For doing so, ProPatrol learns a model for an applicationâ€™s high-level tasks based on analyzing the sequence of system calls it generates. The benefit of this approach is that it considers an application as a black-box and does not rely on binary code instrumentations or source code modifications.

Towards this goal, we survey a wide range of 30 real-world exploit kits and analyze a counter-offensive adversarial model against the kits and kit operator.

One of the promising domains of applying intrusion detection is the healthcare domain. A typical healthcare scenario is characterized by high degree of mobility, frequent interruptions and above all demands access to sensitive medical records by concerned stakeholders. Migrating this set of concerns in pervasive healthcare environments where the traditional characteristics are more intensified in terms of uncertainty, one ends up with more challenges on security due to nature of pervasive devices and wireless communication media along with classic security problems for desktop based systems. Despite evolution of automated healthcare services and sophistication of attacks against such services, there is a reasonable lack of techniques, tools and experimental setups for protecting hosts against intrusive actions. This paper presents a contribution to provide a host-based, anomaly modeling and detection approach based on data mining techniques for pervasive healthcare systems. The technique maintains normal usage profile of pervasive healthcare applications and inspects current workflow against normal usage profile so as to classify it as anomalous or normal. The technique is implemented as a prototype with sample data set and the results obtained revealed that the technique is able to perform classification of anomalous activities.","tags":[],"title":"Host-based Anomaly Detection for Pervasive Medical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Birhanu Eshete","Dawit Bekele","Komminist Weldemariam","Adolfo Villafiorita"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1266354753,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1266354753,"objectID":"e8b971926c3a90d70cf38972d92eff13","permalink":"/publication/context.html","publishdate":"2010-02-16T16:12:33-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/context.html","section":"publication","summary":"Emerging technologies like mobile and wireless communication are offering promising opportunities to enable mobile healthcare delivery to citizens.

Using ICT for ensuring better life requires far more than good infrastructure, ICT know-how and the various techniques and tools in place. If ICT has to address the real problems of the society, it should be at a rescue being environment-friendly, with real and tangible impact, sustainable, seamless, down to the grass-roots and above all with reproducible experiences. In this paper, we introduce a different perspective of looking into and using ICT, which we call ICT for Good (ICT4G). It is about using ICT for addressing problems of societies with low ICT penetration and changing a societyâ€™s life for the better. More specifically, based on our observation of current promises ICT gives to society, we discuss ICT4Gâ€™s distinguishing aspects, opportunities it offers, challenges it imposes along with preliminary roadmap for its realization.

Central to context management is context information refinement aimed at deriving context information that can assist applications inmaking valuable decisions about what to deliver to users. In this thesis, we identified the shortcomings of existing works in relation to context information refinement in pervasive medical systems. The shortcomings are lack of adequate consideration for: quality parameters of context information, relevance of context information and particular requirements of the pervasive healthcare domain. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we proposed a context information refinement architecture that facilitates and coordinates the refinement procedure starting from acquisition of context information up until the refined context information is delivered to the target application (user) in a pervasive medical system by addressing the above- mentioned shortcomings. The architecture is composed of the client mobile device end and the context refinement server. The client mobile device end consists of components responsible for tracking the device context (E.g. location), listening to incoming events from the server, providing interface for specifying service constraints and local caching services. On the context refinement server side, the major components are the reasoning and decision engine that performs ontology-supported context reasoning, the service parameters manager that maintains up-to-date list of service constraints, the context ontology that models the concepts and relationships between concepts in the pervasive healthcare domain and the context acquisition component that collects and aggregates context data from potential context data sources like sensors. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed architecture, we developed a prototype that implements the core components of the proposed architecture. The implementation has been evaluated with a real-life pervasive healthcare scenario and encouraging initial results have been obtained as an indication to the usability of the proposed architecture in a real- life setting.","tags":[],"title":"Context Information Refinement for Pervasive Medical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We focus on analysis, reconstruction, measurement, and defense of cybercrime with focus on cybercrime activities (e.g., phishing, malware) cybercrimen toolkits (e.g., exploit kits, ransomware, and APTs).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b3149c9788367838e7d9ffc61917bb8e","permalink":"/project/cybercrime.html","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cybercrime.html","section":"project","summary":"We focus on analysis, reconstruction, measurement, and defense of cybercrime with focus on cybercrime activities (e.g., phishing, malware) cybercrimen toolkits (e.g., exploit kits, ransomware, and APTs).","tags":["Cybercrime"],"title":"Cybercrime Analysis","type":"project"}]
